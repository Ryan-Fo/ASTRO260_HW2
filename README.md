Submission for homework 2 assignment

Each python file can be saved as a .py and accessed through your command line. For problem 1 it will ask for a value for part C and then immediately also print out the answer for part D.

For question 2: The float_error.py file is incomplete, but if you load it through command line it will show where I managed to get to. This file had all progress on question 2.

To access for me I type python in my command line and have the path to each file saved in file explorer, where I just click and drag to quickly access.
